## About

CLafes is a fun and interactive command-line application built in Java that simulates the experience of ordering coffee at a coffee shop. This project serves as a demonstration of CLI application development, object-oriented programming principles, and basic input/output handling in Java.

This project aims to provide a simple and engaging way for users to interact with a simulated coffee shop environment directly from their terminal. It's perfect for Java beginners looking to explore CLI development or anyone who enjoys a bit of coffee-themed fun.

The application is built using Java and utilizes standard input/output streams for user interaction. The architecture is designed around a set of classes representing different aspects of the coffee shop, such as menu items, orders, and the ordering process itself.

## ✨ Features

- ☕ **Order Customization**: Customize your coffee with various options like milk, sugar, and flavorings.
- 🧾 **Order Summary**: View a detailed summary of your order before confirming.
- 💰 **Simulated Payment**: Complete your order with a simulated payment process.
- 🎨 **Interactive CLI**: Enjoy a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate command-line interface.
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: Easily add new coffee types, customizations, and features to the application.
